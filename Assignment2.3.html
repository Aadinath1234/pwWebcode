            <h1><u>What is HTML :-  </u> </h1> <br> 
            <p>HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is used for creating web pages and
                web applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.

                Hyper Text: HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext.
                Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext.
                HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.

                Markup language: A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting
                conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn
                text into images, tables, links, etc.

                Web Page: A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. A
                web page can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type. With the
                help of HTML only, we can create static web pages.

                Hence, HTML is a markup language which is used for creating attractive web pages with the help of
                styling, and which looks in a nice format on a web browser. An HTML document is made of many HTML tags
                and each HTML tag contains different content. </p>

            <h1>What is Semantic HTML</h1>
            <p>A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

                Examples of non-semantic elements: div and span - Tells nothing about its content.
                
                Examples of semantic elements: form, table, and article - Clearly defines its content. </p>
