Ans: In HTML, tags, elements, and attributes are very helpful to define the structure and the content of a web page.

Tags:


In HTML, tags are used to mark up and define the content of a web page. They are enclosed in angle brackets, and usually
come in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag. There are many different types of HTML tags available, each with
its own specific purpose.

Example: <p>I am happy to learn Web Development.</p>. In this example, the opening tag is <p> and the closing tag is
</p>.

Elements:

HTML elements are the building blocks of web pages. An HTML element is made up of a start tag, content, and an end tag
(in most cases).

Example: <p>I am happy to learn Web Development.</p>. In this example, the opening tag is <p> and the closing tag is
</p>. The content along with the tags is the paragraph element.

Attributes:

In HTML, attributes provide additional information about an element. They are usually included in the opening tag of the
element.

Example: <a href="https://google.com">Go To Google</a>. In this example, the a element is used to create a hyperlink.
The href attribute specifies the URL that the hyperlink points to. The attribute values are enclosed in quotes.

1. <p></p> : The tag is used to represent a piece of text that forms a distinct block of content.

2. <h1></h1> : Headings are used to define the titles or subtitles of a web page or a section of content. H1 represents
the highest level of the Headings.

3. <div></div> : Div creates a container or a division within a web page that can be used to group other HTML elements,
such as text, images, forms, and other HTML tags, into a logical section or a block.

    1. Child >
    Using > operator, we can nest elements.
    
    2. Sibling +
    Utilise the + operator to position elements close to each other, at the same level.
    
    3. Climb Up ^
    When using the > operator, you can traverse down the generated tree, and the positions of sibling elements will be determined in relation to the deepest element.

    9. What are self-closing tags? Write a brief note on meta tags.

Ans: A self-closing tag in HTML is a kind of HTML tag that does not need to be closed manually by its closing tag, which means it does not have a separate closing tag as </tag>. Some few self-closing tags are <input/>, <hr/>, <br/>, <img/>, etc.

Meta Tags.

Meta tags are HTML tags used to provide additional information about a page to search engines and other clients. They do not directly affect the visual appearance of a webpage, but rather provide information about the content of the page.

Meta tags are placed in the head section of an HTML document and can include various types of information, including the title of the page, a brief description of the content, keywords that describe the content of the page, the author of the page, the language of the page, and more.
